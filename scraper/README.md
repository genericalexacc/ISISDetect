# Twitter Scrapper

Fill out the data in `config/_config.js` and then rename `config/config.js`.

Then:

    npm install
    node mine.js "my search term"

## Notes

* Popular twitter hashtag for finding ISIS members #opIsis, links possible terrorist accounts.
* Could process confirmed radical accounts and then train along side non-terrorist tweets (control group should be arabic).
